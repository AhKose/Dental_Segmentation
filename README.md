# Tooth Image Segmentation Using U-Net

This repository contains the implementation of a U-Net based deep learning model for the purpose of segmenting tooth images. U-Net is a convolutional neural network that excels in biomedical image segmentation tasks. This project demonstrates the entire pipeline from data preprocessing and augmentation to model training and evaluation.
